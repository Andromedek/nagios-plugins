Description:
   This is a Nagios plugin command, using the nrpe interface, to return information describing 
   disk throughput.  It displays the amount of time the system is busy with the disk as a percentage
   of CPU time.  It also displays the average queue time im microseconds.  

Build:
   % gcc -o disk_throughput disk_throughput.c

Install:
   Copy the executable disk_throughput to the nagios install dir under libexec
   Example: 
          % cp disk_throughput /usr/local/nagios/libexec/.

Configure:
   Add the following command to the nrpe config file in the nagios install dir 
   under the etc subdir: /usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg.  The -w param is
   the warning threshold and -c is the critical threshold.  Linux docs say
   that a system value of 70% is critical.  

   command[disk_throughput]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/disk_throughput -w 50 -c 70

Start/Enable:
   Re-start the collector on the system from which disk information is collected
   Example:
        % sudo /etc/init.d/afcollector restart
