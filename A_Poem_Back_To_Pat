There once was a man named Yangming,
Who tried ever so hard to sing.
He met a young lady,
Who married him lately.
And now his tonings are as bling.

桃花潭水深千尺
不及派特送我情

A poem pack to Pat:
(Sorry I can't write in English, as I don't even know how to rhyme,
but the one below I wrote with heart and it rhymes well.)

北风催烟岭
千湖渐秋颜
路人掖怀襟
大宅阖门帘
马上千里远
辔系一炊烟
恬足夕有余
别路夜无眠
路长人不识
梦唯君相辨
合院皆与知
天涯永相鉴
